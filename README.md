# :wave: Gitting Started

## ü§ì Course overview and learning outcomes 

The goal of this course is to give you a brief introduction to git and GitHub. We'll learn how to use them
at a very basic level and create our first repository to make code changes in.

## :octocat: Git and GitHub

Git is a **distributed Version Control System (VCS)**, which means it is a useful tool for easily tracking changes to your code, collaborating, and sharing. With Git you can track the changes you make to your project so you always have a record of what you‚Äôve worked on and can easily revert back to an older version if need be. It also makes working with others easier‚Äîgroups of people can work together on the same project and merge their changes into one final source!

GitHub is a way to use the same power of Git all online with an easy-to-use interface. It‚Äôs used across the software world and beyond to collaborate and maintain the history of projects.

GitHub is home to some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics of GitHub, but we'll dig into the rest later.

### Repositories

A repository is where your project work happens--think of it as your project folder. It contains all of your project‚Äôs files and revision history.  You can work within a repository alone or invite others to collaborate with you on those files.

### Cloning 

When a repository is created with GitHub, it‚Äôs stored remotely in the ‚òÅÔ∏è. You can clone a repository to create a local copy on your computer and then use Git to sync the two. This makes it easier to fix issues, add or remove files, and push larger commits. You can also use the editing tool of your choice as opposed to the GitHub UI. Cloning a repository also pulls down all the repository data that GitHub has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder for the project! This can be helpful if you experiment with your project and then realize you liked a previous version more. 
To learn more about cloning, read ["Cloning a Repository"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository). 

### Committing and pushing
**Committing** and **pushing** are how you can add the changes you made on your local machine to the remote repository in GitHub. That way your instructor and/or teammates can see your latest work when you‚Äôre ready to share it. You can make a commit when you have made changes to your project that you want to ‚Äúcheckpoint.‚Äù You can also add a helpful **commit message** to remind yourself or your teammates what work you did (e.g. ‚ÄúAdded a README with information about our project‚Äù).

Once you have a commit or multiple commits that you‚Äôre ready to add to your repository, you can use the push command to add those changes to your remote repository. Committing and pushing may feel new at first, but we promise you‚Äôll get used to it üôÇ
## üìù Assignment

* Move this markdown file to a new path called `instructions.md`.
* Create a new `README.md` file in this repository. Let us know what you learned and what you are still confused about! Experiment with different styles!
* Create your profile README. Let the world know a little bit more about you! What are you interested in learning? What are you working on? What's your favorite hobby? Learn more about creating your profile README in the document, ["Managing Your Profile README"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-your-profile-readme).
